<h2>Week of December 10</h2>
<p>Wow, okay, we went right back from 0 to 60 this week—classic Vegas, am I right? First off, this new spa place? Tainted as fuck! Don't go in without a lot of backup and maybe a flamethrower. (Actually, don't bring a flamethrower, that's how you end up on the news.)</p>
<p>Second off, we got ourselves another meeting this week, and it is a big deal, so put on your very best manners and come ready to be charming. If you embarrass us I will personally show up at your house to yell at you. Not joking.</p>
<p>We're also getting a lot of reports of fungus-related nastiness, a lot of it apparently coming from underground. We know for a fact the tunnel network under the city was connected to the late unlamented Ruric Holt's house full of Fomori and other horrors, so it's looking like more of the same. Between this and the spa, looks like our local Black Spiral hive have been some busy, busy bees. Evil bees. Time to get out the Raid and start spraying, folks.</p>

<h2>Week of December 3</h2>
<p>Guess what, everybody, we have some actual, for-real good news this week. I know, I'm surprised too. We are officially back to "only slightly concerning" on the ghost threat scale (that isn't a real thing, but if somebody makes one I won't not use it). Also, we got the Namers' guy back, and rescued a cub named Melody from the Caern, which is an unambiguous win, go team. </p>
<p>Speaking of Melody, she has an announcement she needs to make, so those of you can, show up at the Mirage at Saturday. </p>
<p>Also, congratulations to Icarus Nubel, Batteries Not Included, on a successful challenge for Fostern!</p>

<h2>Week of November 26</h2>
<p>What is up, folks. Failover here with your weekly bulletin of all the ways Vegas is currently full of problems. This week, we've got spiders of unusual size in the Mojave. Why? Beats me. But we definitely shouldn't, so if somebody could go handle that—let me rephrase, somebody should go handle that. </p>
<p>But the spiders will have to get in line. The Alliance is sending people back to the Ghost Caern this week. It's probably going to go sideways. So, with that in mind, if you can show up, do. We need everybody we can get on this.
</p>

<h2>Week of November 19</h2>
<p>Hey, folks, been a hot minute since I've written one of these, at least according to what I've been told. What with the postapocalyptic reality bubble caused by a Namer and everything. I hated writing that sentence, you all hated reading that sentence, yet it is true. Apparently what I remember happening for the past, oh, month isn't what happened at all and my brain and a lot of your brains just got overwritten twice, which, fucking wow! Hate that! Full offense, sometimes these people suck! </p>
<p>Anyway, serious props to the crew who fixed this whole thing. Good job. Let's never do it again. </p>
<p>In other news, because Vegas never stops, we have an ongoing angry ghost problem and the leeches are acting way up just because screw us, I guess? At least we have some  challenges scheduled for the next Moot. Can't wait. </p>
<p>Raise your hands if you need a win, team, cause I sure do.</p>

<h2>Week of October 15th</h2>
<p> 
Good whatever time it is when this comes out, folks! It’s me, Failover, with only the freshest of scoops. First up, Moot’s coming soon, so everybody get ready to brag and-slash-or complain. Remember, don’t bottle it up, that’s why we do this thing every month. Also, bring good snacks. </p>
<p>I’ve been asked to remind y’all that the Creepshow isn’t a safe zone, no matter how spooky you like it. Pick a different haunted house. Literally any other one. This has been a public service announcement. </p>
<p>Something’s stirring up the spirits of the Mojave—as of now, no clear idea on what, according to the Elders, but a whole herd of them pushed through Vegas out to the other side today, for no reason any of them stopped to explain. If anybody hears anything concrete we'd all sure like to know.</p>
</p>

<h2>Week of October 8th</h2>
<p> 
Once again it's your pal Failover, here with the latest news. 'fraid there's nothing good this week, folks. Surprising nobody, entering the Caern was a bad idea. Be on the watch for angry spirits. Theurges, get thee to the Five.</p>
<p>Closer to home, watch out for the "maternal healthcare" centers owned by one former Ruric Holt. They've got Wyrm taint all over them and are connected to tunnels beneath the city. Also, we have it on good authority they kidnap people. Move in groups and keep an eye on your loved ones. And if you're feeling some arson, remember, check for civilians and it's only a crime if you get caught.
