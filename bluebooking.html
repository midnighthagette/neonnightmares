<h2>An Overview</h2>
<p>'Bluebooking' was first described by Aaron Allston in the Champions supplement "Strike Force". The 'blue book' in question is a standard (in the U.S.) blue book used to answer essay questions during exams. Instead of using it to figure out whether you passed or failed, the blue book was used for in-character dialogues, or actions without assistance of a GM.</p>

<p>Bluebooking describes short gaming sessions that do not involve the entire group, but which instead focus on the actions of one or a few characters.
Bluebooking is nothing more than writing out roleplaying and conversations between characters, rather than acting them out. Usually, this takes place between game sessions. </p>

<p>These scenes could include:
<ul>
<li>thoughts or plans the character is having</li>
<li>private conversations with NPCs (not a scene)</li>
<li>private conversations between other PCs (should be done IC)</li>
<li>past history (or future?!!) scenes</li>
<li>questions to the GM</li>
<li>AND, lastly and leastly, EXP spends.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>This presents a perfect opportunity to use bluebooking. Bluebooking also has the advantage of permanence; you keep the written records of what went on, and can use them to create future scenarios.</p>

<p>I encourage players interested in bluebooking type activities to set up "side games" outside of the regular scenes in which they RP with other PCs, which could satisfy the desire for writing out solo character stuff without it eating up face-to-face game time with a DM. This is mostly for those games that seem to have a lot of in game down time. This helps me keep track of everything that the players are trying to do by looking over their books. That is if the player is actually trying to accomplish something.</p>

<p>I've also found it useful for the GM to convey information to a player that he doesn't want the whole group to be aware of right away, such as when the PC has had his mind taken over or the like (for a player willing to roleplay such an event himself).</p>

<p>Blue booking also allows for roleplaying which is important to the character, but not for the troupe, or the main plot line. These could be personal investigations, interaction with the cast of characters around the character's sheet (Tapping contacts, help from mentors, favors from allies, or work with Kinfolk/Acolytes), research activities, or even just introspective roleplaying. All of these things would bog down a game if the player did them during a session (in most cases), so by doing them via a bluebook (or scene journal, which is another name for them), allows the player to explore these areas without bogging down the game.</p>

<p>In short, the player writes out a play session of what their character does solo (or with the permission of another player) or with other characters. It should be in story format, but does not have to be. The GM reads over what is done and either approves it, approves it conditionally (needs changes), or denies that it could happen. Approved blue book entries become part of the campaign's continuity. Most GM's will award experience spends, talens (or other consumables), Ritual benefits or some kind of reward for blue book activities.  Thinking outside of the box is key here! </p>

<p>Players with characters who have deep secrets will also be fertile fodder for blue booking. The occasional tactician will also use it to direct their investigations. It can add a great deal to a group campaign, when the characters also operate solo most of the time "off camera".</p>

<p>It is not the "End all" of game tools, but it is a useful one in -your- gaming arsenal.</p>

<h2>Why this matters on Neon Nightmares</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column1"><img src="images/bluebook1.jpg" alt="It's a book... That is blue..."></img>
  </div>
  <div class="column2">
<p>Here at Neon Nightmares, we are turning back to the tabletop method of dealing with bluebooking/downtimes. We as STs will not be running 1-on-1 scenes for most xp-related expenditures. The reason for this is simple: We want to focus less on ensuring individual members get their new abilities/powers/etc and more on ensuring the plot keeps moving forward and we can promote an ideal RP environment for our players. To that end, only truly “special” circumstances will result in 1-on-1 scenes with an ST. These include (but are not necessarily limited to): Seekings, Pack Formation Quests, Rank Challenges, etc. </p>

<p>For all other scenarios (such as researching sphere levels, seeking out spirits for gifts, training up abilities or attributes, and so forth we ask that you use the following format for your bluebooking. Also, please note, that if your character lacks a skill needed for this task (such as summoning a spirit for Gifts), reach out to other Players for help instead of an ST as this encourages more IC interaction and builds a stronger IC community. First, have your XP ready for spending (meaning that if you’re buying the first level of a sphere ensure you already have 10xp, or checking that you have the 3xp for a new gift (rank 1 only for Cliath). Next, roll anything that needs to be rolled; such as Cha+Expression to convince the spirit, Dex+Technology to build a Device. Once you have the xp and have rolled what you need to roll, please fill out the following information before pinging an ST (via @Storyteller). </p></div></div>

<h2>How to format your requests:</h2>

<p><b>General format of what you would post in your bluebook:</b>
<ul>
<li><u>Desired upgrade:</u> ((Put your goal here. Example: Buying first point in the Entropy Sphere or Buying the “Open Seal” gift.))</li>
<li><u>XP Cost:</u> ((Put the cost here, this is to save ST time. We might double check to be sure.))
<li><u>Roll Results:</u> ((Success, Failure, Botch))</li>
<li><u>Description:</u> ((Tell us the IC reason your character would get this upgrade. This need only be a 1-3 sentences, depending on the complexity of the task. </li>
</ul>

<p><i>Note:</i> THIS DOES NOT NEED TO BE A SHORT STORY. You can just bullet point it, write a quick description or whatever. We will, however, provide XP bonuses and/or cost reductions for a well written story.)) If you have the xp and we feel the description covers what it needs to, you get your upgrade. No need for a scene. 

<p><i>Also Note:</i> This is also where you would roll for preparation rolls, such as gathering intelligence before going into a scene. In that case, just roll it here and add a note telling us what you were trying to learn. We’ll add a note on what you found here as a reply.

<h2>Beastly Renown:</h2>

<p>Garou and other Shifters have a complex and detailed system of Renown, which having a second form of character advancement makes them unique from Mages (or really any other WoD system). In the interest of keeping Renown tracking, awards, and advancements simple so as to not take significant time above and beyond xp concerns, we at Neon Nightmares will be implementing the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>No single Garou character can accumulate more than one permanent Renown in any given calendar month in any one category. If you have enough temporary renown to claim two points of permanent renown, one can be approved and the next will have to wait until the moot the following month.

<li>When possible, please explain the circumstances and locations (i.e. rooms) where you earned your rep. This is to streamline and double checking the ST team wishes to do.

<li>As tempting as it might be to omit negative renown, please include and mention all appropriate situations where negative renown is earned and list negatives alongside positives. - Garou can submit Renown recognition requests only once per month, specifically at the end of the calendar month.</li>

<li>Said Renown must be submitted via your bluebook prior to the beginning of the monthly moot (This is on the Full Moon of each month, and most are not RP'd out, so please check the date of the full moon and that is your monthly deadline).</li>

<li>A detailed list of (Garou) Renown can be found <a href="images/RenownChart.png"> here</a>. Fera renown varies drastically between Breeds and thus we recommend looking at the W20 Changing Breeds book (pg 219) for examples of their Renown earns. </li>
</ul>
