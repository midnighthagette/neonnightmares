<h2>General Notes</h2>
   <div class="row">
  	<div class="column1"><img src="images/rage.jpg" alt="Not allowed."></div>
   <div class="column2">
   <h3>Rage</h3>
	<ul>
	   <li>Players do not get any automatic Rage unless told by ST. Never assume!</li>
	   <li>Players can never spend more than half your Rage pool in one round (rounding up)</li>
	</ul>
   <h3>Soaking</h3>
	<ul>
   	   <li>Shifters can “soak” Agg Damage from “Tooth and Claw” from supernaturals, Fire, and (non-Wyrm) Toxic Waste. This applies unless specifically overwritten by a book.</li>
	   <li>Shifters CANNOT soak Agg Damage from Sphere Magic which attack patterns, (some) Spiritual attacks, and Silver/Gold (except in breed form, as appropriate).</li>
	   <li>Mages can use (appropriate) Sphere Magick to soak ONE type of Agg at a time (cannot be vague: “Energy” is too broad, “Fire” is acceptable).</li>
	   <li>Willpower Points CANNOT be used on soak (or damage) rolls. No exceptions.</li>
	</ul>
   <h3>Other</h3>
	<ul>
	   <li>After taking your actions, ALWAYS flavor post in the main RP channel for the scene to show what you did (i.e. “Show your work”), but roll first to keep things moving.</li>
	   <li>+/- 3 diff is the cap, anything affecting diff cannot increase or decrease 3 past initial difficulty.</li>
	   <li>Difficulty is 6 for actions unless told otherwise by an ST or the Book (excluding Magic).</li>
	</ul>

<h2>A Treatise on Martial Arts</h2>
   <div class="row">
  	<div class="column1"><img src="images/martial.jpg" alt="Martial Arts."></div>
   <div class="column2">
  	<h3>Creation Considerations</h3>
	   	<p>First of all, what are your options at creation? Simply put, the same rules apply to max ranks as anywhere else on the site, meaning we don’t want to see any five’s right out of the gate and are extremely unlikely to approve any fours either. After all, a world class martial artist co    ming to Vegas would be strange enough but doubly so without a healthy dose of Fame and attention for doing so. This is the sort of thing to end up in the papers and we don’t want anyone attracting that much attention to the supernatural world right out of the gate, y’know?</p>
		<p>Second of all, a few points of clarification. Martial Arts as an ability does NOT include weapon skills. Martial Arts is mechanically a more refined version of the “Brawl” Talent (hence why it’s a “Skill” instead of a “Talent,” after all… Anyone can throw a punch but it requires training to use an Aikido Tenchi-Nage or a Capoeira Meia Lua de Frente (for example). Meanwhile, the “Melee” Skill already implies training in the use of a weapon, whether it's in the form of “stick them with the pointy end” swordsmanship or a Baritsu Tenkan technique. As both imply training, those involving weapons use “Melee” and those using no weapon (or “fist weapons”) use either Brawl or Martial Arts depending.</p>
	<h3>An “In Character” Example</h3>
	       	<ul>
		   <li>Roll Initiative using the diceroller. Current command is "/mi X" (where "X" is your Wits+Dex, form bonuses apply).</li>
		   <li>Turns start at the top of the list and work downward. No declaration rounds.</li>
		   <li>Players may take a Reflexive Action and either an Automatic or Full Action per round without penalty.</li>
		   <li>Rage Turns go AFTER last on Init chart, in order of initiative</li>
		   <li>2m cap per turn to claim your actions, if that is missed, you lose your turn until the next round).</li>
		</ul>
	<h3>A Note on Specialties</h3>
	   	<p>Specialities and Techniques are NOT the same thing. In the above example, Seamus has a specialty in Hard Style Martial arts and Aubrey has specialties in Throws (Brawl) and Baritsu (Melee). When he uses a deflect technique, Seamus does NOT get the use of his specialty as his “Hard Style” does not allow use of the specialty on deflection, but he DOES get his specialty on his initial jab. Both are techniques, but only one gets the specialty bonus. </p>
	   	<p>Aubrey makes wiser use of her specialties above though, as her Baritsu specialty would apply for the Tenkan Hook technique and her Throw specialty in Brawl would apply for the throwing technique. However, her leg sweep technique and blocking techniques have NO specialty bonuses however due to her specialties not applying. To keep the difference simple, a technique is an optional maneuver that may or may not have specialty bonuses applied depending on whether the specialty applies to the technique. If you are ever unclear if a maneuver gets the specialty bonus, just ask an ST!</p>
	   	<p>As a result of this, we DO expect you to define what Martial Art your character studies. Brawl and Melee do not require specialties before level 4 but Martial Arts ALWAYS requires a specialty just like Crafts or Art.</p>
