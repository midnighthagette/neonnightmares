<h2>Da Rules</h2>
<p>Above all others, there are two rules which take precedence and overwrite <i>all</i> following rules:
<ul>
<li><b><i>The King of All Rules:</b></i> Consent is key. You are <i>not</i> allowed to take any action which may remove <i>any</i> degree of player agency and self-determination. Such an action, if it is accidental it's easily rewritten with mutual agreement to move past the issue. However, repeated violations of this rule <i>will</i> result in a ban for the offending player. This includes, but is not limited to: Metagaming, powerplaying, unwilling mind control (if the player is fine, then it is okay IC, but only with consent), unwilling manipulations, using social rolls to "tell" other players how to react, etc.</li>
<br>
<li><b><i>The Queen of All Rules:</b></i> Fun is essential. We are all here to have a good time. This is not a job and players are under no obligation to get along with and scene with every other player. If you are not enjoying yourself, it is fully within your right to "walk away." Just be aware that your RP partner has the same right. Treat each other with respect and do what will be the most fun for everyone and you should never have problems with either rule. But doing things intentionally "unfun" in order to "troll" or otherwise disrupt play <i>will</i> meet with OOC consequences and could result in a ban for repeated offenses.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>With the two most important rules out of the way... Here are the rest of our guidelines:
<ol>
<li>Please respect your fellow players whether in discord, PMs, or in OOC forums. We realize that characters will not always get along and will not always be respectful, but please leave IC issues IC and treat your fellows well. We are all here to enjoy ourselves, after all.</li>
<br>
<li>Please respect our Staff.  We are here to ensure that everything runs smoothly and our shared universe makes its own sorts of sense. Moderators are here to ensure that the site continues to function. Both roles are essential to the site's overall health and we assure you that we are doing our best.</li>
<br>
<li>Please refrain from metagaming/godmodding/conflict of interest. Don't tell other players how their characters react. Don't tell them how you defeated them.   Don't use your other characters to further personal plots or meddle in others.</li>
<br>
<li>Also, if you have found yourself privy to OOC knowledge that your character does not know IC, please restrain yourself from abusing said knowledge. Also, as a special note, this applies to magical powers too; mind control/reading, mutations, magic forms of harm, etc aren't alright without permission</li>
<br>
<li>Plagiarism is not allowed. References and adaptations happen, and are often quite fun to reimagine, but they must be reimagined. Do not take other people's characters for your own. On a related note, quoting/referencing works and writings of others are fine, but please don't copy text for posts.</li>
<br>
<li>Please be aware of our site's setting when making a character. While we follow the "official" canon of the World of Darkness, we have taken things in our own direction.We reserve the right to refuse approving a character if they do not fit in our established version of the setting.</li>
<br>
<li>This site is designed for players 18 years or older and is considered a Mature site. This does not mean that every scene will have mature themes, in fact most will not, but merely that the potential for such stories exist on the site.</li>
<br>
<li>As an additional note, underage characters in sexual situations are strictly forbidden. This is to prevent any potential legal troubles for either your or our sakes, so please understand when this is one of the few rules we will not tolerate being broken.</li>
<br>
<li>IC actions will result in IC consequences. Admin keep up with what is happening on the site. We realize that things happen sometimes IC, predictable or not, that result in some wild things.  We will not however force you to RP anything you are not comfortable with, but compromises will be made!</li>
<br>
<li>For Reference:  We are using primarily 20th Anniversary AND the Revised Editions of Mage the Ascension and Werewolf the Apocalypse. Final rulings will be up to ST Approval and may overwrite any rule/book beyond the King and Queen above.</li> 
</ol>
