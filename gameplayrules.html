<h2>General Gameplay Rulings</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column1"><img src="images/mortal1.jpg" alt="Humanity F-Yeah!"></img>
  </div>
<div class="column2"><p> 
<ul>
<li>As we do not use the Lore ability, most rolls which would use Lore will instead be covered by the Occult ability. Any Lores you would expect to have should be treated as specialties of Occult instead. Remember: You can have more than one specialty and specialties can be purchased with xp.
<li>As editions vary on how to handle specializations, we will define the default as the "exploding 10s" rule from the 20th Editions. What this means is that you do NOT reroll 10s on a specialization roll. Instead, any 10s on a specialization roll will instead count as two (2) successes. The dice-roller bot should be set up to do this automatically, so you need merely add your specialization to the roll when appropriate and it will give you credit for 2 suxx per 10 with no need for you to do anything!</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Shifter Rulings</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column1"><img src="images/shifter1.jpg" alt="Howl at the moon"></img>
  </div>
  <div class="column2">
<p> 
<ul>
<li>The inherent aspect of Shifters called "Animal Magnetism" (i.e. using the "Curse" to seduce an individual) is not permitted. The Merit is unaffected by this ruling.</li>
<li>The Delirium does not affect Mages. However, the Curse (the creeping sense of dread when one instinctively feels the Rage of a shifter) <i>does</i> apply to Mages.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div></div>

<h2>Mage Rulings</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column1"><img src="images/mage1.jpg" alt="Power of Creation"></img>
  </div>
  <div class="column2">
<p> 
<ul>
<li>Due to a bit of confusion over the official rules and affinity spheres, we at Neon Nightmares will be using the ruling that no sphere can be higher ranked than your affinity sphere. Other spheres can match the affinity, but none can exceed it. This is in addition to the "cannot exceed Arete" rule.</li> 
<li>As numerous questions have popped up recently regarding how the player of a @Mage character can request an increase to sphere levels. These are the guidelines that the ST and Mod team here at Neon Nightmares use when considering approval/denial of sphere increases. Do they have the xp? - The most basic question is how much xp do you need? - XP costs are current level x7 for affinity sphere (current x 7). In other words: If its your primary/chosen sphere, you get it cheaper than the other 8. - XP are current level x8 for any non-affinity sphere. (current x 8) Can they increase the sphere to the proposed new level? - What is the character's current Arete? No sphere can be higher than the character's Arete rating. - What is the character's affinity sphere at? No sphere can be higher than the affinity sphere; this obviously does not apply to the affinity sphere itself. Has the character put in the work? - Is there an indication of whether the character has been practicing/studying the sphere? - How long have they been studying/practicing? See the chart below for how long is appropriate.</li>
<ul>
<li>Default learning time (Realtime):</li>
<ul>
<li>Level 1: 14 days</li>
<li>Level 2: 28 days</li>
<li>Level 3: 56 days</li>
<li>Level 4: 112 days</li>
<li>Level 5: 224 days</li>
</ul>
<li>How Library and/or (NPC) Mentor can speed up learning (round to nearest whole day):</li>
<ul>
<li>Level 1: Reduce learning time by 30%</li>
<li>Level 2: Reduce learning time by 35%</li>
<li>Level 3: Reduce learning time by 40%</li>
<li>Level 4: Reduce learning time by 45%</li>
<li>Level 5: Reduce learning time by 50%</li>
</ul>
<li>If both are possessed by the character, average the two scores and add one)

<li>How learning with a PC can speed up learning (round to nearest whole day):</li>
<ul>
<li>Can only learn spheres that are equal/lower than the teaching PC</li>
<li>Must RP at least one "session" of training, rest can be blue-booked</li>
<li>Must have compatible paradigms, differing paradigms require Int+Occult rolls with 5 suxx each (each roll representing an hour of collaberation to 'get on the same page')</li>
If above conditions are met, reduce learning times by 50% and xp cost by 25%</li>
<li><i>Note:</i> Due to the difficulty of dividing focus between multiple aspects of reality, only one sphere can be trained at a time unless studying up to two related spheres. Related Spheres: Conception: Prime, Mind, Spirt Form: Forces, Life, Matter Decay: Correspondence, Entropy, Time</li>
<li>You do not need to have the xp to begin your research and you can begin research on day one after approval if you wish. Simply keep the above guidelines in mind as you begin your bluebook research.</li>
