<h2>Week of March 4th</h2>
<p>Points of order for this week:
<ul style="margin: 10px 0;">
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">STORM FORECAST: The storm has rapidly ramped up in strength and cross-gauntlet travel is possible but not advised.</li>
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">We're seeing a surge of mystic activity in the desert. The majority appears to be ghostly, associated not just with the haunted Caern that produced the Shuck, but with a new dig site that has seen an uptick in discoveries. </li>
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">There is also a disturbing uptick in extranormal water contaminants. The exact vector of the modified cordyceps strain is as yet unknown but believed to be unnatural; this may be a waste product of the process. More analysis is necessary.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
<h2>Week of February 27th</h2>
<p>Points of order for this week: 
<ul style="margin: 10px 0;">
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">STORM FORECAST: The storm has reached a lull this week. As always, exercise care with the gauntlet, but damage is likely to be minimal.</li>
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">The Spectre problem has abated for now, with a marked decrease reported across the city and even in Block 16. </li>
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">It has been officially confirmed that the creature known as the Beast seeks a body. The Alliance, with the invaluable help of the Orpheus Group, blocked its last attempt to steal one, but it will try again. </li>
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">We are pleased to announce that the repairs and new security measures are finished, and the Mirage is once again functioning as the seat of the Alliance.</li>
	
	</ul>
	</p>
	
<h2>Week of February 11th</h2>
<p>EMERGENCY BULLETIN:
We have confirmation of the Spectre's location in the shadow of Block 16. Repeat, we have confirmation of the Spectre's location, all hands on deck now.</p>

	
<h2>Week of February 4th</h2>
<p>Points of order for this week:
<ul style="margin: 10px 0;">
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">STORM FORECAST: The storm is approaching full strength once again, and shows no signs of weakening.</li>
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">Spectral activity has increased around Las Vegas, particularly around Block 16. The Alliance is currently seeking confirmation that the Spectre responsible for the incursion into the Mirage is based there. Once we have it, a team will be dispatched. Be ready.</li>
		  
</ul>
	</p>
	
<h2>Week of January 28</h2>
<p> 
Points of order for this week:
   <ul style="margin: 10px 0;">
     	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">STORM FORECAST: The storm has weakened somewhat, but the Gauntlet is still unsafe and crossing is not recommended.</li>
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">There’s been extensive spirit disturbance in the general area of the Flamingo. It appears to be connected to the hole in the Mirage and the resulting surge in spectral activity, although it may also be the work of the current owners.</li>
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">The vampire presence in Circus Circus seems to be increasing lately; no aggression has yet been reported, but please exercise caution when entering after dark.</li>
   </ul>
</p>
	
<h2>Week of January 14</h2>
<p> 
Points of order for this week:
   <ul style="margin: 10px 0;">
     	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">STORM FORECAST: Be advised the storm is at FULL POWER this week. DO NOT cross the gauntlet physically unless absolutely necessary. </li>
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">We now have confirmation of a magically-cultivated strain of cordyceps fungus loose in Las Vegas. While the number of victims is in the low tens, it continues to spread and as yet there is no word on the source. </li>
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">The Wound is beginning to exceed the Alliance’s abilities to contain it. While at the moment we still have things under control, the situation will become unsustainable soon, particularly as spectres have begun to leak from other locations. The Alliance will dispatch a team to the Block 16 shadow this week to attempt to close the Wound. Those of you with relevant skills, please contact Angela Rothstein as soon as possible.</li>
   </ul>
</p>

<h2>Week of December 31</h2>
<p> 
Points of order for this week:
   <ul style="margin: 10px 0;">
     	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">STORM FORECAST: This week the Storm is present but relatively mild. Exercise care when crossing the Gauntlet. </li>
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">The Alliance will be sending a team into the tear into the Shadowlands cathedral on Monday in an attempt to catch and bind the spectre. Intelligence indicates that it may be under the control of or otherwise associated with the Beast's escaped astral form, so assume that it is even more dangerous than a normal Spectre. Begin your preparations now. </li>
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">We here at the Herald wish everyone a happy, propitious, and hopefully safe New Year. May we all stay in one piece.</li>
   </ul>
</p>

<h2>Week of December 24</h2>
<p> 
Points of order for this week:
   <ul style="margin: 10px 0;">
     	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">The Mirage remains on lockdown. Do not enter alone or without notifying your immediate superiors, whoever they may be, of where you're going.</li>
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">We would like to thank the cross-Alliance team who scouted the tear in the Stormwall. According to their initial reports, the tunnel leads to three places in the Shadowlands: the Flamingo, Block 16, and an unknown religious building about which we advise extreme caution. Further exploration will be required.</li>
   </ul>
</p>

<h2>Week of December 17</h2>
<p> 
Points of order for this week:
   <ul style="margin: 10px 0;">
     	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">EMERGENCY NOTICE: Security breach at the Mirage. There is an active and ongoing spectral threat of unknown origin and great power. All Alliance personnel have been evacuated. Everyone who can, come immediately. DO NOT enter alone or unarmed.</li>
   </ul>
</p>

<h2>Week of December 10</h2>
<p> 
Points of order for this week:
   <ul style="margin: 10px 0;">
     	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">The Alliance will be holding an all-hands meeting at the Mirage tomorrow. Please come if you're able. </li>
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">Our sources in Block 16 report an uptick in thefts of magical objects, and also an uptick in spider sightings. Whether these are related is anyone's guess.</li>
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">Several bodies full of an unknown fungus have been discovered. Their tongues appear to have been cut out pre-mortem, and the fungus liquefied most of their internal organs. Currently, these deaths are hidden from the mundane authorities, but if the volume keeps rising, there are severe concerns about the Alliance's ability to maintain cover.</li>
   </ul>
</p>

<h2>Week of December 3</h2>
<p> 
Points of order for this week:
   <ul>
     	<li>We are incredibly happy to report that Butch Levi is safely home, thanks to the efforts of the Alliance. Please direct all well-wishes to the office of Ela Rosario and they'll be passed along to him. He'll be taking his duties back up soon. </li>
	<li>There are some spiders of concern. Of increasing concern, we should say. If this keeps up, they're going to attract the attention of certain government organizations, which would be even more of a problem than they already are, so let's all do what we can about the arachnid infestation. </li>
	<li>Please join the Alliance for a meeting in the Mirage this Saturday, if at all possible.</li>
   </ul>
</p>

<h2>Week of November 26</h2>
<p> 
Points of order for this week:
   <ul>
     	<li>Please keep in mind that the Springs Preserve belongs to the Garou and permission is required to enter after hours. No exceptions. </li>
	<li>The increase in general ghostly activity continues. Most of it is concentrated on the Flamingo, which according to reports is also now host to a group of vampires. </li>
	<li>A team will be re-entering the Caern to settle the unquiet wraiths this week. This may well cause an extinction burst of some kind, so we advise you to strengthen your magical protections and have a plan to reach the nearest secure area quickly if things escalate. Those of you with combat experience or knowledge of spirits, your assistance is needed. Contact Avril Prentiss at the Sept of Second Chances for more information.</li>
   </ul>
</p>

<h2>Week of November 19</h2>
<p> 
Points of order for this week:
   <ul>
     	<li>Welcome back to Las Vegas, everyone. We here at the Herald don't usually editorialize, but we're more relieved than words can say that we've returned to reality, and we hope that everyone is doing as well as possible under the circumstances. Remember that we have member assistance funds for access to therapy and a list of Awakened-friendly providers at the Pyramid, and everyone is welcome to use them. We would also like to extend special thanks to the Sept of Second Chances for their invaluable help in resolving the bubble. </li>
	<li>First and most importantly, the Torchbearers formally proscribe Sophia Holmes for the crime of attacking and killing Noah Fenwick. In solidarity, the Black Pyramid agrees. She is barred from our halls and our seats of power. Do not give her aid or succor. The terms of the Alliance no longer apply to her. </li>
	<li>Violent hauntings are increasing across the city. They appear to be connected with the ghost Caern. Those of you who actually entered are advised to travel in groups and avoid engaging if at all possible. If it's not possible, report the encounter immediately afterwards. </li>
	<li>The night-folk appear to be contesting turf at the north edge of downtown. Avoid the area after dark if at all possible. </li>
	<li>Recent events may well cause a surge in Awakenings, so please be on the lookout.</li>
   </ul>
</p>

<h2>Week of October 15th</h2>
<p> 
Points of order for this week:
   <ul>
     	<li>There has been a security breach in the area beneath Red Rock Canyon, which has been revealed (somewhat belatedly, your humble correspondents feel) to be the prison of a creature called the Beast. Said Beast managed to free its astral form from the wards on Sunday, and can now move and act in a limited capacity. Signs of its passing include destruction and obvious unnatural lacunae. Once again, report any suspected sightings and avoid engaging.</li>
	<li>Several adepts with expertise in these matters report a marked increase in Umbral tremors and the strength of the Storm this week. Please be mindful and take precautions if your work takes you to the other side of the gauntlet.</li>
   </ul>
</p>

<h2>Week of October 8th</h2>
<p> 
Points of order for this week:
   <ul>
	<li>The Alliance's recent attempt to enter the Caern proved unsuccessful. The team dispatched discovered an army of unquiet Wraiths, who are actively hostile to the living and may exceed the boundarie
s of their current haunt in pursuit of their targets. Please report any sightings of a man with glowing eyes immediately and proceed as quickly as possible to the nearest secure area. </li>
	<li>We report with a heavy heart that Butch Levi of the Order of Hermes is currently missing. Until the situation is resolved, Ela Rosario, also of the Order, will be handling his duties. Please direct all inquiries to them.</li> 
	<li>Any readers with experience in the magics of spirit and entropy are encouraged to report to their representatives as soon as possible.</li>
   </ul>
