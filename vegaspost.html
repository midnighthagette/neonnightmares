<h2>Week of December 10</h2>
<h3>ATTEMPTED ROBBERY AT NEW WELLNESS CENTER: </h3>
<p>Police were called to Healing Springs Health Spa and Spiritual Retreat yesterday afternoon when four assailants, one man and three women disguised as customers, forced entry into the back office and demanded items of value. Several employees were injured in the struggle. The attempted thieves fled before police arrived on the scene. No further information is available at this time. </p>
<h3>HAUNTED VEGAS? :</h3>
<p>Do you believe in ghosts? More and more Las Vegas residents have been reporting spectral sightings, including a viral TikTok video showing a woman in a long white gown apparently jumping out a window and vanishing, these past two weeks. An employee at the MGM Grand, who asked not to be named, told the Post, "The service elevator in the east wing's always felt weird, but the last couple nights I've worked, it always looks like there's someone in it right before the doors open, and if you get in it's like somebody's breathing down your neck. Nobody wants to use it anymore." Some are attributing this rash of supposed hauntings to performance art, a viral marketing campaign, or teenage pranks. Others, however, insist it's real.</p>

<h2>Week of December 3</h2>
<h3>ARRESTS MADE IN SHOOTING CASE: </h3>
<p>Two local men have been arrested in connection with last month's shooting death. Emil Lim, 22, and Dennis Polk, 30, were taken into custody this afternoon, according to a press release. Police say they were also involved in a burglary and assault earlier this year, and have known ties to organized crime.</p>
<h3>HENDERSON PASTOR MISSING:</h3>
<p>Pastor Nathan Forster of Grace Lutheran Church, 43, was reported missing by his wife yesterday. He was last seen in the church parking lot at 3:00 PM on Thursday, wearing a white button-up shirt and black pants. At this time, police are looking into all options. Anyone who has any information is encouraged to call the Missing Persons hotline at (702) 555-555</p>
<h3>GRAND OPENING OF NEW WELLNESS RESORT:</h3>
<p>Healing Springs Health Spa and Spiritual Retreat will officially open its doors next week. Owner Philip Cromwell's press release states that he hopes to create jobs and to bring a sense of "spiritual wellbeing" to Las Vegas. "In these trying times," Cromwell went on, "With so much of our community under threat, it's important to take care of your body and soul." A local healthcare watchdog agency has expressed concern about Cromwell's lapsed medical license, which he did not provide comment on despite repeated requests.</p>

<h2>Week of November 26</h2>
<h3>BODY DISCOVERED IN FLOOD TUNNELS: </h3>
<p>At 6:20 AM this morning, police were alerted to a body in one of the Sandhill flood tunnels. The body belongs to a young woman, but the coroners' office has as yet been unable to identify her due to the advanced state of decomposition. An eyewitness to the discovery, who asked not to be named, said she was found missing both hands and her lower jaw. The investigation is active and ongoing.</p>

<h2>Week of November 19</h2>
<h3>INVESTIGATION INTO MCCARRAN RANSOMWARE ATTACKS CONTINUES: </h3>
<p>After a series of ransomware attacks by unknown hackers shut down McCarran International Airportâ€™s flight control system, the FBI and the DHS are working with local law enforcement to apprehend the perpetrators. No information has been officially released, but an anonymous source stated that the FBI suspects the same ecoterrorists responsible for the power plant are involved.</p>

<h3>SHOOTOUT IN NORTH VEGAS LEAVES THREE DEAD: </h3>
<p>Early this morning, gang violence erupted in North Vegas. Officers responded to reports of gunfire at 3:45 AM this morning, at which point the alleged gang members fled, escaping arrest. Three people, whose names have not been released, were pronounced dead at the scene, two of gunshot wounds, one of several blows to the neck and torso with a bladed weapon. A bystander was transported to the hospital in critical condition after being accidentally wounded in the crossfire. The LVPD said in a news release that there is evidence the shooting began when one participant pulled a gun during an argument. They are actively pursuing several suspects at this time. </p>

<h3>EARTHQUAKE IN THE MOJAVE:</h3>
<p>Seismologists at the University of Nevada confirmed that the faint tremors felt by Las Vegas residents this week were a mild earthquake, a 4.7 on the Richter Scale, originating in Red Rock Canyon. No one was hurt and only minor property damage has been reported.
</p>

<h2>Week of October 8th</h2>

<h3>ECOTERRORISM INVESTIGATION ONGOING: </h3>
<p> Weeks after power has been fully restored to Las Vegas, the question of who's responsible for the bombing of the power plant is still open. The FBI investigation is active and ongoing, but no persons of interest have yet been named. At a press conference this afternoon, Las Vegas Police Chief Lee Raymond said that he has "full confidence in the FBI", and that although he cannot give details at this time, he can confirm that they are following up on several promising leads regarding ecoterrorist groups active in the region. When contacted, Special Agent Percival Belmont refused to provide comment. </p>

<h3>VIGIL OUTSIDE CITY HALL: FAMILIES OF MISSING DEMAND ANSWERS</h3>
<p> Last night, a crowd of hundreds gathered outside City Hall in a candlelit vigil for their missing family members. Attendees carried signs bearing photos of their loved ones and representatives of the Las Vegas Women's Shelter gave speeches. In the last several weeks, over two dozen people, mostly women, have vanished, and their relatives are frustrated with law enforcement's response. Ashley Han, whose sister Rebecca Han-James, 22, has been missing for almost three weeks, said that she's begun to lose hope. "I call and I call and they always say they're doing everything they can, but they don't have anything to show for it," she said. "I want to believe it's going to be okay, but I know how much worse the chances are forty-eight hours. Where is my sister?" North Vegas resident Lewis Sonuga echoed her sentiment, adding that he hasn't heard from police since he reported his wife, Tamsyn Sonuga, 34, missing five days ago. "I just want her to come home," he said. LVPD representatives stated that they feel for the families and are actively working these cases, and ask anyone who has any information to call the tip line at (702) 555-555.
