<h2>Week of March 4th</h2>
<h3>MILITANT ENVIRONMENTALISTS STRIKE AGAIN</h3>
<p>Early this morning, residents of North Vegas awoke to realize they were without water. A local group of militant environmentalists, who many say cross the line into ecoterrorism, quickly claimed credit for the shutdown, saying that Las Vegas has drawn a disproportionate amount of water for too long and they were "evening the score". Several arrests have been made, and city authorities say they are working as quickly as possible to turn service back on.</p>
	
<h2>Week of February 27th</h2>
<h3>SHOOTOUT AT THE FONTAINEBLEAU</h3>
<p>Earlier this week, a driveby shooting erupted outside the unfinished Fontainebleau hotel. Witnesses describe passengers in a black van opening fire at man, who subsequently fired back. No fatalities were reported, and no suspects are yet in custody. </p>
<h3>VIGILANTE ATTACKS ON THE RISE</h3>
<p>Over the past few weeks, a spate of vigilante violence has broken out across Las Vegas. The majority of incidents involve interrupted muggings and a few gang-involved incidents. A young woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, witnessed one of these fights on her way home from a bar and describes the person she saw as "buff and very angry". The police encourage anyone who may have seen anything to call the tipline at (555) 555-5555.</p>

<h2>Week of February 4th</h2>
<h3>BREAKIN AT THE LA PALAZZA MANSION</h3>
<p>A breakin was reported at the La Palazza mansion earlier today. A housing inspector, who had arrived to assess the property prior to putting it back on the market, found that one of the doors was unlocked, and several rooms on the ground floor were disturbed. Nothing of value was taken, although a few items were damaged. Police say they believe the most likely culprits are urban explorers, and urge the community to remember that breaking and entering is still prosecutable even if nothing is stolen.</p>
	
<h2>Week of January 28th</h2>
<h3>ARSON WAVE CONTINUES</h3>
<p>The mysterious series of fires across Las Vegas shows no signs of abating, as another house burned to the ground. Only a single fatality was reported. Police have not released identifying details, but an anonymous source stated that it seems likely the deceased was a person of interest in a joint investigation with the FBI.</p>
	
<h2>Week of January 14</h2>
<h3>ELECTRICAL MALFUNCTION SHUTS DOWN TOP FLOORS OF MIRAGE: </h3>
<p>Popular casino and tourist destination the Mirage had to close its top floors this week after a blown fuse caused widespread power failures. Several employees reported hearing strange noises and seeing flickering lights throughout the entire building before the top floors lost power. The Mirage's management says that the damage is not widespread and should be fixed shortly, and stresses that the casino floors are still open for all to enjoy.</p>

<h2>Week of December 31</h2>
<h3>COMMUNITY LEADERS CRITICIZE POLICE HANDLING OF MURDER WAVE: </h3>
<p>As the recent wave of homicides has rocked Las Vegas, many communities say the police are paying more attention to affluent victims, and have not properly looked into the crimes committed in less wealthy areas of the city. A family member, who wished to remain anonymous, cited a lack of communication or followup from the police. Additionally, local Black Lives Matter activists say they have received death threats and harassment, but were ignored and dismissed when they reported these incidents. "It's very clear what the LVPD's priorities are," said one organizer from North Vegas, "And it's not us."</p>

<h2>Week of December 24</h2>
<h3>FUNERAL HOME BREAK-INS CONTINUE: </h3>
<p>More funeral homes have reported break-ins this week, as a puzzling wave of crime sweeps Las Vegas. Once again, no items of value or money have been reported stolen, but bodies at several locations were disturbed. Some had already been embalmed. One employee at an affected mortuary, who did not wish to be named, said that the locks had been forced from the inside, a detail which independent verification has confirmed.</p>

<h2>Week of December 17</h2>
<h3>SUSPECTED ARSON AT PRENATAL CLINIC: </h3>
<p>Earlier this week, a birthing center went up in flames. Several witnesses report seeing a car crash into the side of the clinic immediately before it burned. The LVPD has opened an arson investigation. Preliminary reports indicate that the car struck oxygen tanks, which ignited, and that the crash appears to have been deliberate. A source who wishes to remain anonymous stated that the clinic’s parent company had taken out an unusually large number of insurance policies with multiple companies just weeks before the fire. The clinic’s director did not respond despite multiple requests for comment.</p>
	
<h2>Week of December 10</h2>
<h3>ATTEMPTED ROBBERY AT NEW WELLNESS CENTER: </h3>
<p>Police were called to Healing Springs Health Spa and Spiritual Retreat yesterday afternoon when four assailants, one man and three women disguised as customers, forced entry into the back office and demanded items of value. Several employees were injured in the struggle. The attempted thieves fled before police arrived on the scene. No further information is available at this time. </p>
<h3>HAUNTED VEGAS? :</h3>
<p>Do you believe in ghosts? More and more Las Vegas residents have been reporting spectral sightings, including a viral TikTok video showing a woman in a long white gown apparently jumping out a window and vanishing, these past two weeks. An employee at the MGM Grand, who asked not to be named, told the Post, "The service elevator in the east wing's always felt weird, but the last couple nights I've worked, it always looks like there's someone in it right before the doors open, and if you get in it's like somebody's breathing down your neck. Nobody wants to use it anymore." Some are attributing this rash of supposed hauntings to performance art, a viral marketing campaign, or teenage pranks. Others, however, insist it's real.</p>

<h2>Week of December 3</h2>
<h3>ARRESTS MADE IN SHOOTING CASE: </h3>
<p>Two local men have been arrested in connection with last month's shooting death. Emil Lim, 22, and Dennis Polk, 30, were taken into custody this afternoon, according to a press release. Police say they were also involved in a burglary and assault earlier this year, and have known ties to organized crime.</p>
<h3>HENDERSON PASTOR MISSING:</h3>
<p>Pastor Nathan Forster of Grace Lutheran Church, 43, was reported missing by his wife yesterday. He was last seen in the church parking lot at 3:00 PM on Thursday, wearing a white button-up shirt and black pants. At this time, police are looking into all options. Anyone who has any information is encouraged to call the Missing Persons hotline at (702) 555-555</p>
<h3>GRAND OPENING OF NEW WELLNESS RESORT:</h3>
<p>Healing Springs Health Spa and Spiritual Retreat will officially open its doors next week. Owner Philip Cromwell's press release states that he hopes to create jobs and to bring a sense of "spiritual wellbeing" to Las Vegas. "In these trying times," Cromwell went on, "With so much of our community under threat, it's important to take care of your body and soul." A local healthcare watchdog agency has expressed concern about Cromwell's lapsed medical license, which he did not provide comment on despite repeated requests.</p>

<h2>Week of November 26</h2>
<h3>BODY DISCOVERED IN FLOOD TUNNELS: </h3>
<p>At 6:20 AM this morning, police were alerted to a body in one of the Sandhill flood tunnels. The body belongs to a young woman, but the coroners' office has as yet been unable to identify her due to the advanced state of decomposition. An eyewitness to the discovery, who asked not to be named, said she was found missing both hands and her lower jaw. The investigation is active and ongoing.</p>

<h2>Week of November 19</h2>
<h3>INVESTIGATION INTO MCCARRAN RANSOMWARE ATTACKS CONTINUES: </h3>
<p>After a series of ransomware attacks by unknown hackers shut down McCarran International Airport’s flight control system, the FBI and the DHS are working with local law enforcement to apprehend the perpetrators. No information has been officially released, but an anonymous source stated that the FBI suspects the same ecoterrorists responsible for the power plant are involved.</p>

<h3>SHOOTOUT IN NORTH VEGAS LEAVES THREE DEAD: </h3>
<p>Early this morning, gang violence erupted in North Vegas. Officers responded to reports of gunfire at 3:45 AM this morning, at which point the alleged gang members fled, escaping arrest. Three people, whose names have not been released, were pronounced dead at the scene, two of gunshot wounds, one of several blows to the neck and torso with a bladed weapon. A bystander was transported to the hospital in critical condition after being accidentally wounded in the crossfire. The LVPD said in a news release that there is evidence the shooting began when one participant pulled a gun during an argument. They are actively pursuing several suspects at this time. </p>

<h3>EARTHQUAKE IN THE MOJAVE:</h3>
<p>Seismologists at the University of Nevada confirmed that the faint tremors felt by Las Vegas residents this week were a mild earthquake, a 4.7 on the Richter Scale, originating in Red Rock Canyon. No one was hurt and only minor property damage has been reported.
</p>

<h2>Week of October 8th</h2>

<h3>ECOTERRORISM INVESTIGATION ONGOING: </h3>
<p> Weeks after power has been fully restored to Las Vegas, the question of who's responsible for the bombing of the power plant is still open. The FBI investigation is active and ongoing, but no persons of interest have yet been named. At a press conference this afternoon, Las Vegas Police Chief Lee Raymond said that he has "full confidence in the FBI", and that although he cannot give details at this time, he can confirm that they are following up on several promising leads regarding ecoterrorist groups active in the region. When contacted, Special Agent Percival Belmont refused to provide comment. </p>

<h3>VIGIL OUTSIDE CITY HALL: FAMILIES OF MISSING DEMAND ANSWERS</h3>
<p> Last night, a crowd of hundreds gathered outside City Hall in a candlelit vigil for their missing family members. Attendees carried signs bearing photos of their loved ones and representatives of the Las Vegas Women's Shelter gave speeches. In the last several weeks, over two dozen people, mostly women, have vanished, and their relatives are frustrated with law enforcement's response. Ashley Han, whose sister Rebecca Han-James, 22, has been missing for almost three weeks, said that she's begun to lose hope. "I call and I call and they always say they're doing everything they can, but they don't have anything to show for it," she said. "I want to believe it's going to be okay, but I know how much worse the chances are forty-eight hours. Where is my sister?" North Vegas resident Lewis Sonuga echoed her sentiment, adding that he hasn't heard from police since he reported his wife, Tamsyn Sonuga, 34, missing five days ago. "I just want her to come home," he said. LVPD representatives stated that they feel for the families and are actively working these cases, and ask anyone who has any information to call the tip line at (702) 555-555.
