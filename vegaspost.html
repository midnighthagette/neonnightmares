<h2>Week of October 15th</h2>
<h3>SHOOTOUT IN NORTH VEGAS LEAVES THREE DEAD: </h3>
<p>Early this morning, gang violence erupted in North Vegas. Officers responded to reports of gunfire at 3:45 AM this morning, at which point the alleged gang members fled, escaping arrest. Three people, whose names have not been released, were pronounced dead at the scene, two of gunshot wounds, one of several blows to the neck and torso with a bladed weapon. A bystander was transported to the hospital in critical condition after being accidentally wounded in the crossfire. The LVPD said in a news release that there is evidence the shooting began when one participant pulled a gun during an argument. They are actively pursuing several suspects at this time. </p>

<h3>EARTHQUAKE IN THE MOJAVE:</h3>
<p>Seismologists at the University of Nevada confirmed that the faint tremors felt by Las Vegas residents this week were a mild earthquake, a 4.7 on the Richter Scale, originating in Red Rock Canyon. No one was hurt and only minor property damage has been reported.
</p>

<h2>Week of October 8th</h2>

<h3>ECOTERRORISM INVESTIGATION ONGOING: </h3>
<p> Weeks after power has been fully restored to Las Vegas, the question of who's responsible for the bombing of the power plant is still open. The FBI investigation is active and ongoing, but no persons of interest have yet been named. At a press conference this afternoon, Las Vegas Police Chief Lee Raymond said that he has "full confidence in the FBI", and that although he cannot give details at this time, he can confirm that they are following up on several promising leads regarding ecoterrorist groups active in the region. When contacted, Special Agent Percival Belmont refused to provide comment. </p>

<h3>VIGIL OUTSIDE CITY HALL: FAMILIES OF MISSING DEMAND ANSWERS</h3>
<p> Last night, a crowd of hundreds gathered outside City Hall in a candlelit vigil for their missing family members. Attendees carried signs bearing photos of their loved ones and representatives of the Las Vegas Women's Shelter gave speeches. In the last several weeks, over two dozen people, mostly women, have vanished, and their relatives are frustrated with law enforcement's response. Ashley Han, whose sister Rebecca Han-James, 22, has been missing for almost three weeks, said that she's begun to lose hope. "I call and I call and they always say they're doing everything they can, but they don't have anything to show for it," she said. "I want to believe it's going to be okay, but I know how much worse the chances are forty-eight hours. Where is my sister?" North Vegas resident Lewis Sonuga echoed her sentiment, adding that he hasn't heard from police since he reported his wife, Tamsyn Sonuga, 34, missing five days ago. "I just want her to come home," he said. LVPD representatives stated that they feel for the families and are actively working these cases, and ask anyone who has any information to call the tip line at (702) 555-555.
