<h2>The Sheet</h2>
<p> 
Our Mage sheet can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Os0xdw6fokIayJhuSssnHcXK60zjx4M/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107204034581252761410&rtpof=true&sd=true"> [Here]</a>.
<p>
<h2>Step 1: Concept</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column1">
<img src="images/mage1.jpg" alt="Magic!"></img></div>
  <div class="column2"> <h4> Special Note: Check <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PLinj6bgUEZ0l7kFr0O7HzD4RpqP-z9eOBj0Q_Zejeg/edit?usp=sharing">[here]</a> for details about the Torchbearers!</h4>
<ul>
<li>Essence: Please only use the four listed essences in the book (i.e. Dynamic, Static, Entropic, and Balanced/Questing). None of the “fifth essences” will be approved.</li>

<li>Affiliation: This is your Tradition, Craft, etc. Please note that any non-Tradition affiliation will not be approved unless they are also a member of the Torchbearer Sect. You can find more information <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PLinj6bgUEZ0l7kFr0O7HzD4RpqP-z9eOBj0Q_Zejeg/edit?usp=sharing">[here]</a>.</li>

<li>Sect: This is where you state your character’s political group. Are they a member of the Traditions or one of the rogue mages of the Torchbearers?</li>

<li>Concept: This is a 2-4 word summary of what your character is all about </li>
</ul> 


<h2>Step 2: Attributes</h2>
<p> 
<ul>
<li>Mages begin with 1 free point in each attribute.</li>

<li>They may then distribute their given points in the following categories: Physical, Social, and Mental.</li>

<li>The primary category will get 7 points, the secondary category will get 5 points, and the tertiary category gets 3.</li>

<li>You may take a specialty in any attribute, but there are only mechanical benefits if the given attribute is at 4 or above (which any character with more than one 4 or any 5 will be heavily scrutinized).</li></div>
</ul>
</div></div>
</p>

<h2>Step 3: Abilities</h2>
<p> 
<ul>
<li>Mages do not get any free points in Abilities</li>

<li>They may distribute their given points in the following categories: Talents - which are innate abilities anyone can refine, Skills - which are abilities which generally need at least some basic training from others, and Knowledges - which are abilities which require education and/or experience to possess.</li>

<li>The primary category gets 13 points, the secondary gets 9 points, and the tertiary category gets 5 points to distribute abilities in that category.</li>

<li>Crafts/Technology/Esoterica/Science require a specialty at any level, other abilities may have a specialty to represent a focus but will only receive mechanical benefits if the given stat is 4 or above (which any character with more than two 4s or any 5s will be heavily scrutinized).</li>

<li>Note that your character may (but is not required) to take an additional language beyond their native tongue for each dot in the Academics ability. Additional languages cost freebie points. If you wish to purchase additional languages beyond your Academics points, you may also purchase the 1pt Merit "Language" for each and every additional language.</li>

<li>We do not use the Linguistics ability on this site.</li>

<li>We generally do not use "Secondary" abilities (Jetpack or Teaching, for example) on this site. Consult with an ST if you have questions about secondary abiilities.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Step 4: Advantages</h2>
<p> 
<ul>
<li>Your character has 7 background points to spend at creation.</li>

<li>We do not allow PCs to have any background trait above 5. We also have house rules directly relevant to backgrounds; these can be found [here].</li>

<li>As an additional note: please take at least one point in the Avatar background.</li>

<li>Mages start with 1 point in Arete (without it, they wouldn’t be Mages)</li>

<li>Mages start with 5 points in Willpower</li>

<li>Please also note which specialty sphere your character has chosen from their Tradition/Convention/Craft.</li>

<li>You may select one point in resonance. A resonance is a 1-2 word description of the “flavor” of the character’s magic. When using magic in an appropriate context (such as “Preserving” or “Gaudy” in the Luxor) their magic is at a -1 difficulty to cast. They may also qualify for less paradox, depending on the effect and the exact context. This is not required. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Step 5: Finishing Touches</h2>
<p> 
<ul>
<li>You may list your character’s known Rotes (i.e. spells). You may take as many rotes as double your character’s Arete at creation for “free.”</li>

<li>You have 25 Freebie points which can be spent to increase any one trait of the following categories for its stated cost.</li>
<ul>
<li>Attributes: 5 freebies</li>
<li>Abilities: 2 freebies</li>
<li>Backgrounds: 1 freebie</li>
<li>Willpower: 1 freebie</li>
<li>Arete: 4 freebies</li>
<li>Sphere: 7 freebies</li>
<li>Rotes: 2 freebies</li>
</ul>
<li>You may purchase up to 7 points worth of Merits with your freebies if you so choose.</li>

<li>You may “buyback” up to 7 points worth of freebies in Flaws if you so choose.</li>

<li>Please consult the Merit/Flaw banned and restricted list before submitting your character. This list can be found <a href="creationrules.html">[here]</a>.</li>
</ul>
