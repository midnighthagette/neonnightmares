<h2>General Background</h2>
<p> 
Roughly two decades ago, the End of All Things arrived. The skies bled. The endless screams of half-formed souls reverberated across the cosmos. The wondrous places of the world began to fade and die away. Worst off all, no one noticedâ€¦</p>

<p>The Avatar Storm, as some mystically inclined individuals called it, heralded the arrival of the death of everything. The half decade that followed in its wake saw the arrival of many signs and tragedies which seemed to point to the Apocalypse finally arriving to this world, but very few of these signs were ever seen outside of the spirit realms. The End was creeping ever closer, when it suddenly stopped. No one alive knows who, how, or why but the End of All Things came to a screeching halt before the Masses ever saw a sign of what was happening. This is not to say that the world is safe, as the entities which strive to drive existence towards Stasis or Oblivion are as strong as they have ever been, but someone or something has found a way to buy the world some precious time to find a way to prevent the Apocalypse from reaching its fatal terminus.</p>

<p>In the decade and a half since the world teetered on the brink, the mortal world has grown increasingly hostile to the Guardians of Gaia and the Willworkers who fight for a better future. The mortal agency known as First Light, originally founded to seek out Vampires and other undead threats to Humanity, has allied with radical factions of the Technocratic Union and driven to hunt any Reality Deviant that walks the physical realms. Hunted and harried, both Willworkers and Gaians find themselves with dwindling safe havens as the Spirit Realms recoil in fear from the Physical, leading many sacred sites to weaken or die off. Birth Rates, always unpredictable amongst the Gaians, have become ever less reliable as their patron grows more distant from the trauma. One small glimmer of hope remains however, as those who have the chance to Awaken and become one of the Willworkers have begun to realize their reality-shaping abilities in untold numbers since the days of legend; though with the loss of so many of their wisest and most ancient teachers, there are few able to help foster these potential defenders of a brighter future.</p>

<p>In the areas surrounding Las Vegas, long a bastion of spiritual hope and power driven by the energy which flows through the resorts and casinos there, is one of the rare few places to still boast more than a handful of sacred sites. For mutual survival and to bolster their dwindling hope, the Gaians and the mystically or innovatively inclined Willworkers of the region have forged a tenuous alliance of mutual aid. Bolstered by this Alliance, the two groups have reached a strange equilibrium and have stabilized the mystic energy of their territories. This is not to say that everything is going well for either. The Gaians have recently lost one of their strongest Septs in the region to a horde of their corrupt cousins. The Mages find themselves torn with increasing factionalism and rebellion amongst the youngest of their ranks. Both are harried by both First Light and their mysterious benefactors in the Technocratic Union. Bubbling beneath all these conflicts simmers the lingering legend of the Big Spring, a sacred site of unimaginable power which promises a better future (or a far worse one) for any who find it.</p>
